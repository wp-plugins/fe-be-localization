Different Localization in front- and backend adds the possibility to use different localization in frontend and backend. This plugin was quickly written by me due to a request in the [official german WordPress support forums](http://forum.wordpress-deutschland.org/).

None.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the folder fe-be-localization/ to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
3. Activate the plugin from your Wordpress admin panel.
4. Installation finished.

== Usage ==

Inside wp-config.php

`<?php define ('WPLANG', 'de_DE'); ?>`
you can specify the frontendâ€™s language as usual.

Inside the plugin file fe-be-localization.php in line 13 you can additionally specify the backend's language, which can (and should!) be different to the one you specified in the wp-config file. For example:

`<?php $locale = 'en_US'; ?>`
